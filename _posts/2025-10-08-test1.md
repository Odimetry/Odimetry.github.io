State-space equation
===
In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system that uses state variabels to track how inputs shape system behavior over time through first-order differential equations or difference equations. The most general state-space representation of a linear system with p inputs and n state variables is written in the following form:

$\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)+Bu(t)$ \\
$y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$

where: \\
$x$ is called the "state vector", $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$\\
$y$ is called the "output vector" $y \in \mathbb{R}^{q}$\\
$u$ is called the "input(or control) vector" $u \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$\\
$A$ is the "state matrix" $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$\\
$B$ is the "input matrix" $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$\\
$C$ is the "output matrix" $C \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times n}$\\
$D$ is the "feedthrough matrix" $D \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times p}$\\

In cases where the system model does not have a direct feedthrough, D is the zero matrix.\\

observability
---
Observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is observable if and only if(iff) \\
$rank [C CA ... CA^{n-1}]^{T} = n$
